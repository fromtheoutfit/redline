# Standards for PR #89 Review Round 1

The following standards apply to this work. Each is copied as it reads at `1a7bf67`, before this round's retrospective: the bullets the round applies, as earlier review rounds did.

## testing/tests (excerpt: the bullets this round applies)

# Tests

Seven harnesses, no framework, each runnable alone, and all of them through `.claude/redline/checks.sh --baseline`.

- (line 10, its round-trip clause) ... and the round trip: a title as the workflow posts it, read back and posted again, comes out byte for byte the same, one case per mode, proven red by removing the decode at intake. The loop test cannot render, so a claim about what GitHub shows is checked once through `gh api markdown -f mode=gfm` on invented text and recorded in the spec (the #85 follow-up spec; #87)
- (line 23, its first sentence) A change that touches a tested surface adds a case in the same commit: a guard row, a loop check, a prefs case, a gate case or a setup case, and a row beside it for the neighbouring decision that must not change; ...
- (line 25) A case named for a boundary asserts the boundary itself: one that says it checks a header's last line matches the last non-blank line of the output, not text a few lines before it, or a cut between the two still passes (#34, R2-1). A check's name states only what it asserts: #85's result check was named for the round record keeping the dropped entries and the result keeping counts only, asserted neither, and the result keeps the accounting by design, so a change to either stayed green under a name that said otherwise (#86, R2-2)
- (line 28) A bug fix lands red before green: the case that reproduces it is added first and seen to fail, then the fix. For the guard, the new rows alone go through `tests/guard-test.sh <file>` for the red run, which takes seconds, and the whole table for the green one (#54)

## process/docs-gate (excerpt: the first bullet)

# Docs gate

Every spec names the README, `docs/` and template changes it needs, so a public reader is never behind the code.

- Gate step 10 in `.claude/commands/agent-os/shape-spec.md`: for each file added or altered under `scripts/`, `skills/`, `agents/`, `templates/`, `workflows/`, `hooks/` or `.claude-plugin/`, and for each new config key, subcommand, allow rule or exit code, the plan names the README section, or the `docs/` file and section (and template, if any), and either the commit that updated it or "no reader-facing change" with the reason ...

## process/release (excerpt: the first bullet)

# Release

The plugin's version is the manifest's, every PR moves it, and a release is a person's tag and changelog entry after the merge (#16).

- Every PR bumps `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and the marketplace entry in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` carries the same string: minor when the change alters what a setup rerun writes (`scripts/checks-template.sh` below its header, a file under `templates/`, an allow entry, the unattended section's body), with the template markers it touches bumped in the same PR; major for a contract change a rerun cannot carry; patch otherwise. ...

## prompts/attribution (excerpt)

# Attribution

Redline labels its own work as Redline and never as a model or a vendor.

- `Redline round N` review titles, the `redline:` commit prefix, the `Redline handoff` comment and `decided by: redline` are a tool's name and are allowed everywhere
- No `Co-Authored-By`, no "Generated with", no model or vendor name in a commit message, PR body, review, reply, issue, spec file or standard. ...

## process/standards-retrospective

Applied through gate step 12 as the unattended section's point 8 states it: the edits are proposed in `shape.md`, approved by the standards approver, and applied in their own commit, or "Standards retrospective: no changes" is recorded under Decisions.
