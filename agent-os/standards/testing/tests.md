# Tests

Four harnesses, no framework, each runnable alone, and all of them through `.claude/redline/checks.sh --baseline`.

- `tests/guard-test.sh` over `tests/guard-cases.tsv`: every row is the hook input Claude Code would send (`agent_type`, tool, command or path) and the decision expected. A `# @cwd PLUGIN` line sends the rows after it from the checkout, where the repository is the plugin. About 60 ms a row; 350 rows on 2026-10-21
- `node tests/loop-test.mjs`: `workflows/redline-loop.js` under scripted `agent()` and `parallel()`; it asserts which agents ran, in what order, with what prompt text, and what the script returned. No model, no GitHub, no repository
- `tests/prefs-test.sh`: the merge rules of `scripts/redline-prefs.sh`, in a throwaway repository under the temp directory
- `tests/gate-test.sh` over `tests/gate-fixtures/`: the gate parser and the stamp of `scripts/redline-gate.sh`, on one synthetic `shape-spec.md` per gate shape seen so far, mutated with `sed` and `awk` in the temp directory; the fixture hashes are pinned inline, and the last case checks this checkout's own stamp (#6)
- A change that touches a tested surface adds a case in the same commit: a guard row, a loop check, a prefs case or a gate case, and a row beside it for the neighbouring decision that must not change
- A comparison of two command outputs passes when both are empty, so a harness pins at least one output against a literal before it compares outputs with each other (#6)
- `.claude/redline/checks.sh` carries the gate stamp (`# redline-gate:`); a change to the backticked text of the gate list in `shape-spec.md` restamps it in the same commit, and the gate test's last case proves it (#6)
- A bug fix lands red before green: the case that reproduces it is added first and seen to fail, then the fix
- The tests write only under the temp directory and `~/.cache/redline/`, never into the checkout
- The gate records its baseline time in `.claude/redline/checks.sh`'s header; a test that doubles it says why in its own header
