# Standards retrospective

Every spec ends by asking what it taught, mechanically, and the answer lands in a standard or is recorded as "no changes".

- Gate step 12 in `.claude/commands/agent-os/shape-spec.md`: list every Decision in `shape.md`, every deviation in `plan.md`'s As built, and every check that went red and was fixed by learning something; classify each as already in a standard, missing, or contradicting one
- Approved edits land in their own commit, separate from the spec's code. Code that enforces a new rule (a guard-cases row, a loop-test check) follows in its own commit with the case proving a violation fails
- In a Redline run the shaper proposes the edits under `## Standards retrospective (proposed)` in `shape.md`, the standards approver approves the list, and the implementer applies it in one commit
- When nothing changes, `shape.md` records "Standards retrospective: no changes" under Decisions, so the absence is deliberate and visible
- A round a person finishes by hand, outside the run (a pending decision applied, a deferred full fix made), still owes its record in the same PR: the round's `shape.md` records the decision with its owner and commit, its proposed retrospective lands or reads 'Standards retrospective: no changes', and every standard that named the change pending says what landed, not only the README and `docs/`: `6ef58a9` applied R3-4 with neither record, and `a70c243` narrowed the guard while `scripts/guard.md` still called it pending, until the next round found both (#80, R4-1, R4-2)
- A standards edit keeps the file's headings: they diff empty against `main` unless the spec names the section it adds, renames or removes
- `index.yml` lists every standard and nothing else; a new file is added to it in the same commit, alphabetised by folder and file
